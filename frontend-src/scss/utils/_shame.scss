// ==========================
// Shame
// ==========================
// - this is place for code we're not very proud of. The code which feels dirty
//   but you don't know/don't have time to deal with it at the moment.
// - it should be refactored someday later
// - it lives here so it won't get forgotten
// - if there is nothing in this file, well done champs! :)
